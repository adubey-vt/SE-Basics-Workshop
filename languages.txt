I wasn't feeling well today and couldn't come to class so I don't have a partner. I answered the following questions on my own:


What is your favorite programming language? Why?


My favorite programming language is Java. It is the language that I have been programming in the most and am the most comfortable using. Java is a great first OOP language 
to learn and in my opinion, is very logical in terms of syntax compared to some other languages. I've heard that a lot of people enjoy Python and I can see why but I think its 
been harder for me to adjust to it since I haven't used it as much as Java.


Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?


My favorite language is the one that I am most experienced in, which is, Java. Python would second place for me.
